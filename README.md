# 🛡️ Hi, I’m D'Andre — GRC Analyst in Training | IT Project Manager | CX/UX Advocate

I’m a cybersecurity graduate student at UMGC and an IT Project Manager with a strong foundation in **governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)**, **customer experience (CX/UX)**, and real-world defensive security work.

My career blends **technical cybersecurity operations**, **policy development**, and **human-centered technology**, giving me a unique ability to bridge communication between leadership, engineers, and end-users.

I’m building a portfolio that showcases my journey from IT project management → GRC analyst, → long-term security leader.
